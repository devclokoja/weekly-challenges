## Technical Writing

We had an [AMA with Favor Ori](https://web.facebook.com/groups/devclokoja/permalink/2983504448391908/) some weeks ago where he shared insights on how he got started in programming, founded FavCode54, WeJapa and sold 2 startups [college situation ($70k) & Tugure ($17k)].

Re-watch the live stream [here](https://web.facebook.com/groups/devclokoja/permalink/2983504448391908/) and write a recap article to summarize the key points from favors introduction, story and answers to some of the questions asked.
